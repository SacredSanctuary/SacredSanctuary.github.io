			Candles are always a beautiful way to bring natural light and warmth to your home, office, or sanctuary; but did you know that they are so much more? Candles bring in the element of spirit. They help us connect and heal our connection to God and all that which would guide us to living a fuller life. Candles represent the will and whenever we light one, we set an intention. The candles we sell at Sacred Sanctuary are hand selected or created to bring in the best energy to heal, protect, bless, and support.

			Healing Crystals are special gifts from our Mother Earth. The stones are beautiful and can add interest and beauty to any space or collection, but on a deeper level, it is what they offer to serve your life that makes them magical. Each crystal is formed with a special vibration and energy that when worked with can bring in healing. Whether it is specific to life events, health, energy, or just a way to connect to the Earth’s higher consciousness; stones and crystals bring such a sacred reverence to our lives.

			Oracle / Tarot Cards are divination tools used to help us psychically develop and better connect consciously to spirit. They are so much more than tools to tell the future. When used correctly, they are blue prints for how we can live better lives truer to our passion and purpose. They can help us study ourselves and our own minds and hearts in a way that few other tools can. We understand that learning to use a Tarot or Oracle deck can be intimidating, but we are willing and ready to answer all of your questions and offer classes to assist you in getting to know and use your decks.

			At Sacred Sanctuary, we have books on a wide range of metaphysical and spiritual topics. From self-help, to books that address deep magical and metaphysical matters, you can find a little bit of everything. Books are not only a way to increase knowledge, but through increasing knowledge can enrich the way we interact with and understand the world around us. Any time we invest into reading a book that brings in greater knowledge about spirit, we invest in learning to live a better, fuller life.

			Jewelry is of course a way to adorn our bodies and make ourselves feel valued and beautiful. Jewelry, however is also a personal set of symbols that express aspects of ourselves that tell the world and those around us how we feel about ourselves and what personal philosophies we hold. At Sacred Sanctuary, we carry jewelry that is not only beautiful but meaningful. Our goal is that when you wear it, you feel as though it helps you connect to the very best aspects of yourself. This is what conscious self-expression is all about.

			Wall and Home Decor is much like jewelry in that it beautifies and adds something special to a Home, but it is also a way to express so much more. It brings in meaning to a home, office, or sanctuary. It holds a power that invokes an emotion to help us bond with our environment as it represents the outward expression of ourselves in our space.
