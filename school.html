			<h1>What is a Mystery School?</h1>
			<p>
			A <strong>Mystery School</strong> is a place where reality and the divine come together. Mystery school’s have existed for a very long time on this planet. They have kept secret, as well as revealed, the truths of the human race and our universe. Many adepts have sought and sacrificed their lives in order to receive these ancient truths, and now today they are available more freely than ever before, though it takes more effort to decode them due to the overwhelming amount of distractions and false beliefs. Mystery school’s have existed on every corner of this planet, and they continue to exist today, with a purpose to propel humanity into greatness and into a global loving brotherhood. Our Mystery School is based on tradition, and an understanding of the great universal mystery teachings, and most importantly, the magic!

			<h2>What is Magic?</h2>
			<p>
			<strong>Magic</strong>, or alchemy, is what happens when a mystery school brings in the ancient teachings and a human soul is ready to receive the wisdom, and what happens next is unexplainable… but something changes! Magic literally means to take something… ignorance for example, and to change it into something else… a new perception for example. One who desires the magic in life, he/she must first seek the knowledge, and when a student gains the wisdom, the “magician” is born. Are you here to be a magician in this life? Do you wish to create your own reality and fulfill your divine contract to be all you meant to be? If so, it will require the magic!

			<h2>What is Alchemy?</h2>
			<p>
			<strong>Alchemy</strong>: To take someone, and their soul, aligned to spirit, and to teach them, guide them, and show them how to become a master themselves through the ability of weaving the ancient teachings, magical tools, and sacred rituals into the magical process of self-transformation! Alchemy is pure magic, and it was originally designed for us! And, it’s process takes a lifetime.

			<h2>The Universal Mystery School</h2>
			<p>
			<strong>The Universal Mystery School</strong> is deeply rooted in this ancient wisdom, and incredibly magical! We are unique in how we offer the universal studies to best bring in the greater mysteries. The veil is lifted in Alchemy, where the foundation is established and the teachings and essential rituals are handed down. Then one can enhance their alchemy and master themselves through the four sacred paths: Universal Qabalah, Universal Shamanism, Ritual Mastery, and by learning Magic in The High Priestess Temple.
			</p>
			<p>
			There are three levels of personal mastery: Alchemy, Healer, and Guide. An Alchemist’s work is to master Thyself. A Healer’s work is serve others. A Guide’s role is to serve The Hierarchy of Light and by serving heaven and earth in a way that is pure and true to our God.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>The Universal Mystery School</strong> is a place of sacred knowledge, high standards for the evolution of the human soul, where within the walls of our temple the magic & mystery is forever unfolding, and our brotherhood and sisterhood of love and support continually grows and builds strength. It is our belief that there is a Great Plan that was set into motion a long time ago… and mystery school’s to adepts and masters of light have all been a significant part of the legacy of these sacred teachings, and we for one, are here to keep the truth alive… so that we can finally go beyond survival and learn to thrive!

			<h2>The Way</h2>
			<p>
			<strong>The Way</strong> in which we hand down these sacred teachings and guide our alchemists to honor them and live them is quite magical. It is a true way of honoring all that is sacred and precious to the evolution of mankind. Therefore, it is done in a universal way, and without dogma. Though there is usually a transition period for most souls who grew up in religion to learn and understand True Religion… and this is simply something that must unfold. We have mastered our way of bringing these teachings to life, and requires readiness, discipline, dedication, and accountability. No one can master YOU for you!
