			For the Magic... and thank you for your generous consession for my alchemy audit, I couldn't have done it without that act of kindness and truly, I can't do anything that I'm doing without the influence, affect and inspiration of your teachings. You are a gift. So far beyond words is my gratitude for you.

			Dear Lani,
			<br />
			No gift would ever match all that you have given to me. I know the journey has just begun for me and as I humbly walk with your guidance, I think new shoes are in order. May we always walk in Beauty, embrace change, and be a part of the magic!

			Lani-
			<br />
			There is little I can say to express my sheer joy and respect of these XIII Steps.  It all feels so huge and mystical, yet comfortable and right.  I feel home when I am in the temple with you and the other priestesses.  The Goddess power is alive!  Thank you for all you do for me and the greater good.  I'm flattered to be a part of it and humbled to spread the light.  Here's to all the magic around us!
			<br />
			Much love & respect!  xo

			That burning feeling in my heart drew me to these teachings and Lani Renee in 2012.  I became an Alchemist and it truly has changed my life for the better, with the wisdom and understanding of who I AM.  I floundered my whole life - always feeling as if I wasn't enough.  Now I know why and it's true what they say - the Truth shall set you free!

			I have been attending classes at Sacred Sanctuary for the last 5 years this November 2015.  I was very hesitant when I first started, but now I do not know what I would do without these universal teachings.  They have brought me joy and have also shown me where I need to do my work so that I can have my connection to the divine.  Sometimes the work seems hard, but it is at these times I have seen great rewards.  My heart has been opened and I have a l clearer understanding of who I am and what my personal journey is.  The support from this community is down to earth and non-judgmental due to the understanding that we all have our own journey and we all go through rough patches.  I have grown in the way I live my life and how I am the only one that can live my life.  Our journey is about us and the love we have for ourselves.  My eyes are wide open and I am so thankful that I have been given the opportunity to be a part of such a wonderful place.
