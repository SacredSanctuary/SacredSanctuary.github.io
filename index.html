			Our Sacred Sanctuary
			</h2>

			<p>
			Welcome to <strong>Sacred Sanctuary</strong>! We are a <strong>Metaphysical Center</strong> located in the heart of Olde Town Arvada, directly across from the new Light Rail Station. We are so happy with our new space around the corner on Grandview Ave. so make sure to come see us on your next visit to Old Town! When you come into Sacred Sanctuary you will first experience our spiritual boutique, <strong>INSPIRATIONS</strong>, which offers a variety of spiritual products, and beautiful specialty gifts to enhance your sacred lifestyle. Our spiritual boutique is quite unique and a fun place to find new sacred treasures! You will be greeted by our friendly and knowledgeable team who can help you find that special gift for yourself or someone you love, as well as help you explore the other aspects of all that we offer here at Sacred Sanctuary.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once you’ve been inspired by the beauty of the boutique, you can explore Sacred Sanctuary’s heart & soul and meet our Spiritualist and Master Teacher, <strong>Lani Renee</strong>, and learn about <strong>The Universal Mystery School</strong>.   Lani is one of kind, and purely magical. Her work is an accumulation of her lifetime of learning and deepening what she has learned through teaching others and sharing all she has mastered.  When you come visit us, Lani may not be available, so it is best to make an appointment to meet with her for a reading or initial consultation. Lani has over 20 years of personal experience, and is gifted, dynamic, heart-centered, and always willing to help a willing soul evolve. She is the “door” to The Universal Mystery School, which offers: universal alchemy, universal qabalah, universal shamanism, ritual mastery which is the path of the spiritual warrior, and the high priestess path for those wishing to practice divine magic.
			</p>
			<p>
			Sacred Sanctuary honors the sacred traditions, and stands for spiritual integrity and offers a spiritual education that is truly life-transforming! It is our belief that every human soul has a special destiny, and through the power of our collective energies, nurturing our well-being, and being dedicated to the magic and mystery of life, we are changing lives, one soul at a time.
			</p>
			<p>
			Come and experience a place where inspiration meets style and spirit!  Enjoy our boutique, meet with Lani and have a powerful reading, take a class and get started, or simply come enjoy the sacredness, the community, and the love!
			</p>
			<p>
			From our heart, to yours,<br />
			Namaste

			<h2>
			About Us…
			</h2>

			<p>
			The creators of Sacred Sanctuary are two extraordinary women who are passionate and committed to the work of creating spiritual beauty and facilitating true spiritual progression. They have dedicated their lives to the soulful care of each other, and their community. Both are dedicated to Sacred Sanctuary, for it is a sacred place that supports their true guardianship of The Great Work.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Lani Renee</strong> and <strong>Karna Denae</strong>, come from two different worlds, but found common ground and a similar story when their spiritual journey’s met at a crossroad. This intersection of divine intervention was the beginning of an instant friendship and lifetime of sisterly love. Lani and Karna both have a background of successful careers, and “life in the real world,” but it is their shared passion for higher learning and understanding the mysteries of life that supports their dynamic partnership. Both Lani and Karna are highly educated and trained alchemist’s, devoted high priestesses who serve the high temple, and two sacred souls holding the space for others to deepen their own spiritual practices. Their dynamic partnership combined with their personal spiritual journeys, and love and respect for each other, makes this magical duo a strong force in helping people in today’s struggling world by offering an exclusive and beautiful sacred sanctuary for spiritual seekers to call home!

			<h2>
			Our Mission…
			</h2>

			<p>
			Our Mission at Sacred Sanctuary is to Change Lives! One soul at a time… We do this by providing a sacred environment, honoring the ancient ways and sacred traditions of the enlightened ones and masters who succeeded to the light and left the secrets for us to unfold, so that we can share our knowledge and magical experiences with everyone who enters our “threshold” of transformation.
			</p>
			<p>
			We believe in God, The Hierarchy of Light, and the Good of All. We are here in service to care for the human soul and to honor The Great Work. And we do what we do, with beauty and grace, because there is no other option, no better mission to fulfill, and no other way to live but in alignment with our Creator.
