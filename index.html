			<h2>
				About Us…
			</h2>
			<p>
			The creators of Sacred Sanctuary are two extraordinary women who are passionate and committed to the Great Work.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Lani Renee</strong> and <strong>Karna Hall</strong>, both high Priestesses and true Alchemists, have built a sacred sanctuary for all souls seeking a door to spirituality.  Lani & Karna share a background of successful careers, and “life in the real world,” but they too have always shared a deep desire to know the truth.  One raised Catholic, the other Christian, their dynamic partnership combined with their personal spiritual journeys, makes this magical duo a strong force in helping others find their way by offering a whole new opportunity to embracing modern spirituality!

				Our Mission…
			</h2>
			<p>
			We at Sacred Sanctuary believe there is more to this life...and that the ageless wisdom of all true religions, ancient philosophies, and sacred practices, have been valuable legacies for us to learn from… but it is definitely time for us to bring life to the great knowledge and finally create a New Way to Live!
			</p>
			<p>
			This is what we believe the Great Ones/Masters meant when it was said, “Be the Change You Wish to See in the World.”
