			Like many of you, we at Sacred Sanctuary are spiritual seekers with a human soul searching for a deeper meaning to life.  We are also, successful women, wives, mothers, and sisters, who believe that the mystery is waiting to be revealed to each of us...you simply need to know how to magically access it!  And if you don't yet believe in the magic, or the mystery of life yet, we can help you, guide you, and share the mysteries with you when you are ready!  For we believe we are all destined to live more fulfilling and happier lives.
			</p>
			<p>
			As we searched individually on our own paths, we were drawn together to walk and serve together.  Each of us wondering if our spiritual journey's would ever make sense.  How is it that we live in the modern world, but know that there are ancient ways that were handed down to carry us forward, and yet still see very little trace of the hidden magic in today's civilization?
			</p>
			<p>
			We now know that it takes time, dedication, and absolute trust in the process, as we are living examples that the beauty of our spiritual paths have aligned us in our work, and it is now our mission to offer our gifts to the world.
			</p>
			<p>
			We have built a magical place... where all souls are welcomed!  Whether you are looking for answers or for something special, we are here to share with you all we know, and don't know.  We believe in the mystery, so there is always more...we are progressive and empowered by a vision that is both for bettering humanity, and that also serves beyond this world.  We care about each other, and love what we do.  We want to bring the magic and mystery back to life, we want to place the magic into your hands, and teach you verses preach to you, and empower you to be touched by the one thing we are so passionate about and are truly grateful for... the greatest thing that comes from all that we do... love.
			</p>
			<p>
			We are here to love.   So, from our hearts to your heart...Namaste
