			About the People at Sacred Sanctuary
			</h1>

			<p>
			Like many of you, we at Sacred Sanctuary are spiritual seekers with a human soul searching for a deeper meaning to life. We are also, successful women, wives, mothers, and sisters, who believe that the mystery is waiting to be revealed to each of us...you simply need to know how to magically access it! And if you don't yet believe in the magic, or the mystery of life yet, we can help you, guide you, and share the mysteries with you when you are ready! For we believe we are all destined to live more fulfilling and happier lives.
			</p>
			<p>
			As we searched individually on our own paths, we were drawn together to walk and serve together. Each of us wondering if our spiritual journey's would ever make sense. How is it that we live in the modern world, but know that there are ancient ways that were handed down to carry us forward, and yet still see very little trace of the hidden magic in today's civilization?
			</p>
			<p>
			We now know that it takes time, dedication, and absolute trust in the process, as we are living examples that the beauty of our spiritual paths have aligned us in our work, and it is now our mission to offer our gifts to the world.
			</p>
			<p>
			We have built a magical place... where all souls are welcomed! Whether you are looking for answers or for something special, we are here to share with you all we know, and don't know. We believe in the mystery, so there is always more...we are progressive and empowered by a vision that is both for bettering humanity, and that also serves beyond this world. We care about each other, and love what we do. We want to bring the magic and mystery back to life, we want to place the magic into your hands, and teach you verses preach to you, and empower you to be touched by the one thing we are so passionate about and are truly grateful for... the greatest thing that comes from all that we do... love.
			</p>
			<p>
			We are here to love. So, from our hearts to your heart...Namaste
			</p>

			<h2>
			Lani Renee
			</h2>

			<p>
			Lani Renee is a magical spiritualist: a born channel, and gifted pioneer of progressive spirituality. She grew up a free spirit in California, with a catholic education and degree in health science from SDSU, but forever searched outside the box of normalcy in order to nurture her gypsy soul. Always inspired by her conscious family and environment, Lani learned early to follow her heart and trust her journey… and she did just that. She started her spiritual work in the Healing Arts and Native American Shamanism, and was fortunate enough to work and study with some very influential people who would eventually lead her to her gifts.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lani was a successful fitness specialist for 16 years, spent 15 years healing her soul before she ever considered helping others, traveled the sacred medicine wheel with one of her special healer/teachers, and was blessed with many years working with a Lakota chief who touched her heart and work deeply, until she found her way into an International Mystery School which strengthened her spirituality and mission in life with experience in Ireland, Canada, North America, and South America. She excelled and served on their leadership, until her soul once again led her to continue to her own destiny and the creation of her own school. After 8 years as the owner of Sacred Space in Florida, she was guided to Colorado where she started over and opened Practical Spirituality, which grew into her partnership with Karna and the home of Sacred Sanctuary in Old Town Arvada. Creator of The Universal Mystery School, Lani’s work is truly the incredible greater work of her extraordinary life! She is available Mon-Fri for private sessions, and teaches on Sunday. Check out The Universal Mystery School’s calendar and our upcoming classes!
			</p>
			<p>
			Lani is intuitive, highly energetic, soulful, and has a heart that is pure magic. She is progressive in her own sacred spirituality, highly educated in the universal mystery teachings, and a living conduit of true light work.  She is a gifted healer, master teacher, and holy guardian (alchemist, qabalist, healer, ritual master/spiritual warrior, and beloved high priestess).  She is in service to The Hierarchy of Light, and All of The Great Work here on Earth.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lani’s gratitude runs deep…she is grateful for every day that she has been given, for every healer/teacher she has learned from, and every student who has crossed her path… especially those who have continued to progress alongside her; but her deepest gratitude goes to her family, her beautiful daughter, and loving husband.

			<h2>
			Karna Denae
			</h2>

			<p>
			Karna Denae is a compassionate and creative woman who has helped guide countless souls to succeed in life, with a spirit that leads, and a hearts that naturally gives to all. Karna is a progressing spiritualist who works by Lani’s side and facilitates all of the magic. Her creativity and expression of beauty has always been her gift and she brings that very important piece to Sacred Sanctuary in everything she does.
			</p>
			<p>
			Karna grew up in the country of Wyoming near the Black Hills, and has always had a deep connection to the sacredness of the earth and its animals. Raised Christian, but forever questioning her place in the world, her path started early and continues to this day. She moved across the country and opened her first business at 23, raised two children on her own, and is now a grandmother of four, and now is enjoying her life with her husband and family while doing the work she loves.
			</p>
			<p>
			Karna has always been highly intuitive, but stepped onto her path of spiritual studies when she met Lani, finally realizing that what she had been searching for her entire life actually existed! The moment she took Alchemy all of her doors opened and the answers to all of her questions literally led her to completely changing her life. She is now the blessed owner of Inspirations, Sacred Sanctuary’s Spiritual Boutique, but she is also a progressing alchemist, intuitive qabalist, supportive ritual master/spiritual warrior, and sister high priestess to Lani Renee.
			</p>
			<p>
			She is a hardworking, dedicated businesswoman who has learned to integrate her spiritual purpose into her life’s work. She is now intuitively providing the magical tools that universally support every spiritualist in their sacred practice through providing the boutique at Sacred Sanctuary. She is humble and grateful to be able to offer her business expertise in service and support of the progression and evolution of the world.

			<h2>
			Darshana Renee
			</h2>

			<p>
			Darshana Renee is a magical soul with a heart of gold. Lucky in so many ways to have found her spiritual path early in life, but she also has a story that broke her connection to spirit and possibly stole her dreams as an aspiring figure skater. Darshana met Lani at a time when she prayed for help, and it happened to be the same time Lani moved to Colorado. There was an immediate connection between the two, and within a week of Lani’s arrival, Darshana became her first student. She is an Alchemist, and she has studied and traveled all four of the sacred paths multiple times and is one of Sacred Sanctuary’s Holy Guardians.
			</p>
			<p>
			Raised with dogma, Darshana has liberated herself developing her magic and natural abilities to heal. Having done extensive soul searching, personal healing, and years of alchemy with Lani and The Universal Mystery School, she decided it was time to put her gifts to use and went to massage school and is now doing massage therapy at Sacred Sanctuary.
			</p>
			<p>
			Darshana’s massage is therapeutic, intuitive, stress releasing, deeply healing, and comprehensive to meet her client’s needs from relaxation to deep tissue to healing touch. Her innate wisdom goes far beyond her years, and her ability to help your body feel better and benefit from each massage is definitely a gift!
			</p>
			<p>
			Treat yourself, or someone you love, and make an appointment today with Darshana Renee and come get a massage in our sacred healing temple and experience her magic yourself!
