			<h1>Lani Renee</h1>
			<p>
			Lani Renee is a Magical Spiritualist: a born channel, and pioneer of progressive spirituality. She made her start in California as a successful personal trainer with a health degree from SDSU. She successfully transformed the lives of her clients by helping them transform their health. Through her own need for healing she found her way to the higher teachings and applied her same unwavering dedication to her spiritual progression. She studied in an International Mystery School in Ireland, Canada, North America, and South America eventually rising to be part of the leadership of her school. She is now a successful and professional tarot reader, highly intuitive spiritual guide, gifted energetic healer and carrier of spirit’s medicine, and Master Teacher of the New World Mystery Teachings.

			Lani is one of a kind, a true Holy Guardian with a spiritual practice based in her humility and reverence in service to herself, humanity, and the Great Work.  She is talented, energetic, loving, and transformative.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lani’s gratitude runs deep…she is grateful for every day that she has been given, for every healer/teacher she has learned from, and every student who has crossed her path… especially those who have continued to progress alongside her;  but her deepest gratitude goes to her family, her beautiful daughter, and loving husband.
