			<h1>What is a Mystery School?</h1>

			<p>
			A Mystery School is a place where our reality and our divine reality come together. Mystery Schools have existed for a very long time on this planet; with their secrets left behind in every culture, religion, and ancient practice. They were called “mystery schools” because they were based in mysticism, or what we call esoteric truths, but over time their teachings were lost or destroyed. The fact that these Mystery Schools and under currents of Sacred Metaphysical Teachings have endured the tests of time and are still in existence today, is an absolute miracle! This “miracle” continues to call those whose fate guides them to find one, and when you find your Mystery School, know it is considered a divine calling.
			</p>
			<p>
			For many souls the mysteries remain secret, but for those who are called, the “door” opens; and the secrets are revealed. This door is a spiritual threshold, and it can be life changing, because it will always lead you to our sacred truth that being human has a mysterious destiny that is only known within the greater universe.
			</p>
			<p>
			Why are the Mystery Schools important? They are important because we are so much more than what we’ve been taught and it is time in our divinely inspired evolution that we understand where we come from and remember why we are here!
			</p>
			<p>
			Many well-known and famous adepts in history have sought and sacrificed their lives in order to receive these ancient truths, and now today these teachings are available more freely than ever before, though it takes more effort to decode them due to the overwhelming amount of worldly distractions and false beliefs. For this, we are grateful for the existence of Mystery Schools, and we are even more grateful that they continue to exist today with a purpose to propel humanity into greatness and into a global loving brotherhood/sisterhood.
			</p>
			<p>
			The greatest magic perhaps of The Universal Mystery School is the teachings themselves and how they are handed down. Verbal “handing down” of these sacred teachings is traditionally the only way one is taught, “from the mouth of the teacher to the ears of the student.” This is why one cannot find these teachings in any one book, although one may find a great many books written on a great number of subjects that were spawned from these teachings. Everything from astrology, alternative healing, science, religion, philosophy, tarot, psychology, yoga and so much more have their roots in the Universal Mystery Teachings. These teachings are truly Divine Powers brought to life uniquely in every class. They are ancient, they are sacred, and magically experiential. These teachings are transformative, mystical, and though they are universal; they are capable of working with each individual uniquely. They are the Truth of every Soul. They require reverence, discipline, dedication, protection, and humility. They are blessings to those who are ready to receive them. Are you ready?

			<h2>What is Magic?</h2>

			<p>
			Magic is an ancient alchemy. Alchemy exists when there is a process of change or transformation that has an element of supernatural or spiritual energy to thank for it. In ancient times, alchemy was the scientific process to change base metals into gold, but they had a deeper agenda that got lost over time…and it was to explore the philosopher’s stone, which was a mysterious tool of transmutation and transformation capable of transforming something ordinary into something special. The ultimate goal being to take our human reality of just surviving and to magically, esoterically, energetically, and spiritually develop into the divine beings the ancients once thought us to be!
			</p>
			<p>
			Magic is therefore, taking something and changing it into something else. Like you; or anyone who is ready to experience their own absolute magnificence!
			</p>
			<p>
			When you are ready to discover the truth, and when you are ready to receive the universal mystery teachings, you too can begin to understand how to unlock the ancient wisdom that is inherit in your soul, and you too can embrace your own divine contracts within the mysteries, and it will be then that you can join us and finally live the beautiful life you were born to live!

			<h2>The Universal Mystery School</h2>

			<p>
			The Universal Mystery School was founded by Lani Renee, a master teacher of the universal mystery teachings. It is a lifelong manifestation of her divinely guided life, her background and degree in Health Science and 16 years of working in the Physical Health Industry, to her Shamanic work with both a Medicine Woman and Lakota Chief, years of personal progression with alternative healers, and masterful teachers, to her time in an international mystery school and serving on their leadership until she knew it was her destiny to take her own experiences and share them with the world!
			</p>
			<p>
			The Universal Mystery School is truly the work, dedication, and magical transformation of Lani Renee, and her gifted ability to teach her students, today’s alchemists the way of self-mastery.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Universal Mystery School is deeply rooted in the diversity of spiritual disciplines, and magically integrates shamanism, hermetic philosophy, universal qabalah, meditation and prayer, holistic healing, alternative thinking, esoteric studies, anatomy and physical well-being, to the sacred ways of the ancient high priestess teachings, and the great work of the spiritual warrior, and has a special ingredient of its loving community and service to the Hierarchy of Light. It wouldn’t be a mystery school if the mystery did not continue to reveal itself through the teacher and the teachings. It is such a deep honor and privilege to share this ancient wisdom and all of the incredible magic! We are unique in how we offer the universal studies to best bring in the greater mysteries.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Universal Mystery School is a place of sacred knowledge, high standards for the evolution of the human soul, where within the walls of our temple the magic & mystery is forever unfolding, and our brotherhood and sisterhood of love and support continuously grows and builds strength. It is our belief that there is a Great Plan that was set into motion a long time ago…and mystery schools to adepts and masters of light have all been a significant part of the legacy of these sacred teachings, and we for one, are here to keep the truth alive…so that we can finally go beyond survival and learn to thrive!

			<h2>What is Alchemy?</h2>

			<p>
			Alchemy is where the journey begins…Alchemy is the first step into studying in the Universal Mystery School, and it is where the truth is revealed. It is a two day weekend course that is both spiritually educational and magically experiential; Alchemy will literally change your life!
			</p>
			<p>
			The veil is lifted in Alchemy, where the foundation is established and the teachings and essential rituals are handed down. Then one can enhance their Alchemy and master themselves through the four sacred paths: Universal Qabalah, Universal Shamanism, Ritual Mastery, and by learning Magic in the High Priestess Temple.
			</p>
			<p>
			There are three levels of personal Mastery: Alchemy, Healer, and Guide. An Alchemist’s work is to master Thyself. A Healer’s work is to serve others. A Guide’s role is to serve The Hierarchy of Light and by serving Heaven and Earth in a way that is pure and true to our God.
			</p>
			<p>
			In Alchemy, the teachings have a way of offering you and your soul, a true alignment to Spirit and a deep understanding of God and the Hierarchy of Light.
			</p>
			<p>
			Alchemy is metaphysical knowledge that has been known throughout the history of time as ancient and sacred teachings that carry the mystery of our origin. These teachings awaken the depth of man and are an expression of our divinity. At this time, because humanity believes in so little, these teachings are the truth of the Fatherhood of God, the Motherhood of Gaia, and the Brotherhood of Man.

			<h2>What is an Alchemist?</h2>
			<p>
			An Alchemist is a human being wholly dedicated to the transformation of themselves from human to divine. Alchemists work every day to master their lower nature and heal the blocks and separation that humanity has created from God. An Alchemist believes in The Great Work, and spends their lives working towards the completion of it; which is a total marriage between God and Man, Heaven and Earth. We do this for ourselves, our loved ones, our communities, and ultimately for God. An Alchemist believes that God is all and it is God or the Light that creates all in its own image for the purpose of experiencing itself in divine physical form. It is through the virtue of the Alchemist who self-masters spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and physically that the God experience is realized.

			<h2>Are You Called?</h2>

			<p>
			Are you reading this? You may have the answer! To be called to the universal mystery teachings is a magical awakening, or at times a life-long process of questioning, searching, and finally discovering a time or place in your life to step through a greater threshold of the unknown to ultimately be face to face with your True Self!
			</p>
			<p>
			We are truly called by a part of us that has endured the test of time, and has waited eternally for this moment. Welcome to You!
			</p>
			<p>
			Seek and you shall find. When the student is ready, the teacher appears. The Universal Mystery School will change Who You Are forever…

			<h2>The Invitation</h2>

			<p>
			It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.
			</p>
			<p>
			It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive.
			</p>
			<p>
			It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain! I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it or fade it, or fix it.
			</p>
			<p>
			I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own, if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, to be realistic, to remember the limitations of being human.
			</p>
			<p>
			It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul; if you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy.
			</p>
			<p>
			I want to know if you can see beauty even when it's not pretty, every day, and if you can source your own life from its presence.
			</p>
			<p>
			I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, “Yes!”
			</p>
			<p>
			It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up, after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done to feed the children.
			</p>
			<p>
			It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and not shrink back.
			</p>
			<p>
			It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you, from the inside, when all else falls away.
			</p>
			<p>
			I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.
			</p>
