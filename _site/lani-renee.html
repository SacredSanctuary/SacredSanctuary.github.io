			A <strong>Tarot Reading</strong> by Lani Renee is a powerful spiritual process that offers you the opportunity to ask any question about anything or anyone, that if answered by a higher truth can literally change your perspective, guide you to making decisions, help you see things more clearly, assist in deep healing, clear past cycles or ancestral patterns, to looking at health concerns, relationships issues, financial issues, to then seeking the spiritual guidance that can help you move forward to succeed in life.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lani has been reading the tarot professionally for over 15 years, and works best with clients who are not looking for a fortune teller, but rather an intuitive to help guide them through life with the desire to personally progress, and to fulfill the destiny of their hearts. <i>Lani is available for phone and skype readings</i>.

			<h2>Life Wheel Reading</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-3">
			<p>
			The <strong>Life Wheel Reading</strong> is typically done after your initial reading with Lani. It is a magical process that begins with you working through an instructional packet to discover your archetypes. You will discover that you have a set of 12 primary archetypes, which will then be placed in the 12 houses that make up your “life wheel.” There are four universal archetypes that are related to your survival and will help you understand how you grow and progress in this life, while the other eight archetypes are chosen from the vast storehouse of archetypes dating back to the beginning of human history. The awareness of your archetypes will reveal hidden traits that can help guide you in every aspect of your life, including: the healing of your inner child, facing your shadows and areas that you tend to be stuck in, plus relationships, finances, your highest potential, to your connection to God or the Divine.
			</p>
			<p>
			A Life Wheel is a very powerful intuitive tool that will come to life in this special reading with Lani. You will see how each archetype in the 12 houses will symbolically guide you through a complete understanding of how “you” work! Like the tarot or other spiritual tools, your wheel will help you decode the behind-the-scene patterns of both your story and your potential, so you can experience the absolute best life possible!
			</p>
			<p>
			The Life Wheel Reading is fully loaded with information so it is recommended to bring a recorder. It is also highly recommended to schedule a monthly reading to follow up and learn how to use or "turn" your wheel. This reading is considered Lani's Masterpiece!
			</p>
			<p>
			 1 hour to 90 minute session

			<h2>DNA Activation</h2>

			<img class="featurette-image img-responsive" alt="DNA Activation" src="/public/img/dna-activation.jpg">
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-5">
			<p>
			<strong>DNA Activation</strong> is an etheric healing modality that brings in tremendous light based on the ancient wisdom first formulated in the temple of King Solomon. This activation of light was done to keep the human body youthful and connected to its spirit body to ensure enlightenment and one's highest potential of the integration of the physical and spiritual DNA. Our DNA has 12 codons of physical and spiritual DNA strands that make up the double helix that is our internal stairway to heaven. So in essence, every DNA Activation gets us "closer" to God, and to becoming more like our God-Self. It is recommended to have a DNA Activation once every 1 to 3 months for the best progressive results. Lani Renee has done over a thousand DNA Activations and cannot express in words how sacred and powerful this experience is! Get activated today!
			</p>
			<p>
			30 minute to 1 hour session
			</p>
			<h2>DNA Reading</h2>
			<p>
			<strong>DNA Reading</strong> is a channeling from the eleventh codon revealing the record of one’s spiritual DNA and valuable information such as the origin of one’s spirit, information on past life emanations, one’s oneness with God, the archangelic self, one’s blue print for self-mastery, to a description of the higher self, and more! This reading requires a DNA Activation done within 7 days of your DNA Reading. Bring a recorder! (Most smart phones have ability to record)

			<h2>Emotional Cord-Cutting</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-3">
			<p>
			An <strong>Emotional Cord-Cutting</strong> is an energetic healing modality that releases emotional ties, cords, and attachments that are no longer serving one’s soul or progression. If you have emotions still flowing or triggering you from old or failed marriages, past or current relationships, a death of a loved one, toxic friendships, painful childhood experiences, and/or any heavy emotion you feel is keeping you down or holding you back, then this type of “letting-go” would be perfect for you!

			<p>
			30 minute session

			<p>
			An <strong>Energetic Healing</strong> with Lani is an experience that will touch your heart and reconnect you to your soul! Her ability to take you to a place of deep healing is pure magic! She works with your inner child, guides, ancestors, the archangelic energies of Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, and Uriel, along with your higher-self, and/or whatever part of “you” or universal energy is needed! In a healing, you will feel deeply relaxed for all healings are done while lying on a massage table; you will be consciously supported throughout the healing with her use of essential oils; as well as feel grounded and safe with the comfort of all the crystals she uses in her healings. Lani has been doing healing work for over 20 years, and incorporates everything she knows into each healing session. Her expertise, compassion, and channeled energy will reconnect you to your heart, help you release the past, and live more authentically.

			An <strong>Exorcism</strong> is a very powerful healing modality that has the power to remove dark entities and/or demonic energies out of a person’s soul. Lani is very particular on who she will or will not do an exorcism for, due to its intensity and dangerous environment. Cost also varies depending on the situation.
